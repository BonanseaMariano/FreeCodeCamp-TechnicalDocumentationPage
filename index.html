                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                    implementation
                    dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let developers
                    write once,
                    run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
                    without the
                    need for recompilation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
                    regardless
                    of the underlying computer architecture. Java features include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is an object that encapsulates data and behavior, making it
                        excellent
                        for large, complex applications.

                        Platform Independent: Java follows the principle of WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), allowing
                        applications
                        to run on any device with a JVM.

                    Java is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language. In Java, everything is an object
                    that has
                    state and behavior. Java enforces strict type checking and provides robust class inheritance
                    mechanisms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unlike some other programming languages, Java requires all code to be inside classes, and every
                    class
                    must have a corresponding file name that matches the class name exactly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Java supports four main principles of object-oriented programming:
                    - Encapsulation
                    - Inheritance
                    - Polymorphism
                    - Abstraction

            <article>
                To get started with writing Java, create a file named HelloWorld.java and write your first program:
                <code>public class HelloWorld {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            System.out.println("Hello World");
                        }
                    }
                </code>
                Compile and run this code using the Java compiler (javac) and Java runtime (java).

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Java identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because Java is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42;</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42;</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                    generates a strict Java warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13;</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
                    Variable scope below.
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                    is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Java before Java SE 8 does not have block statement
                    scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                    function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                    example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                    function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } System.out.println(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    Java SE 8.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } System.out.println(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code>

                    Class scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables and methods within a class. In Java,
                    variables
                    and methods declared within a class are accessible to all methods of that class. However, their
                    visibility to
                    other classes depends on the access modifiers used (public, private, protected, or default).

            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the final keyword.
                    The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                    and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <code>final double PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                    scope variables. If the final keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                    assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>

                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR void f() {}; final int f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO void f() { final int g = 5; int g;
            //statements }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
                statement is executed without problems.
                <code>final MyObject MY_OBJECT = new MyObject("key", "value"); MY_OBJECT.setKey("otherValue");</code>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest Java SE standard defines several data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Primitive data types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>boolean:</strong></strong> true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>null:</strong> A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                                Java is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                                NULL, or any other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>undefined:</strong> A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>int:</strong> 42 or 3.</li>
                            <li><strong>double:</strong> 3.14159.</li>
                            <li><strong>String:</strong> "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>char:</strong> A single 16-bit Unicode character.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
                you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
                methods are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                think of objects as named containers for values, and methods as
                procedures that your application can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
            <header>if else statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
                condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                statement, including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
                which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
                statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
                when nesting if statements:

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
                glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
                an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

            <header>switch statement</header>
            <article>
                A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression's
                value to a case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement. A switch
                statement looks as follows:

                <code>switch (expression) { case value_1: statement_1; break; case value_2: statement_2; break; default: statement_default; }</code>

                <p>
                    The program first evaluates the expression. It then attempts to match the expression's value to a
                    case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement. If no match is
                    found, the
                    program executes the statement following the default label. The break statement associated with each
                    case label ensures that the program breaks out of the switch statement once the matched statement is
                    executed. If the break statement is omitted, the program continues to execute the next statement in
                    the switch block.

                <p>
                    Also there is a way to group multiple cases together. This is shown in the following example:
                </p>
                <code>switch (expression) { case value_1: case value_2: case value_3: statement_1; break; case value_4: statement_2; break; default: statement_default; }</code>
                <p>
                    In this example, if the value of expression is value_1, value_2, or value_3, statement_1 is
                    executed.
                    If the value of expression is value_4, statement_2 is executed. If the value of expression does not
                    match any of the specified values, the program executes the statement following the default label.

            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
                condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
                false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
                the statement following the loop.

                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                    If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                    condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                    group those statements.
                </p>

                Example:

                <p>
                    The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                </p>

                <code>int n = 0; int x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                    true, so the loop terminates.

            <article>
                A method definition (also called a method declaration, or method
                statement) consists of the method keyword, followed by:

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the method.</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the method, enclosed in parentheses and
                        separated by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Java statements that define the method, enclosed in
                        curly brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple method named
                    square:
                </p>

                <code>public int square(int number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                    The method square takes one argument, called number. The method
                    consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                    method (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                    statement specifies the value returned by the method.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to methods by
                    value; the value is passed to the method, but if the method
                    changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally or in the calling method.
